-- Objective: To conduct an in-depth analysis of a dataset sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pertaining to heart disease and its potential influencing factors.

-- Goal: The primary aim of this analysis is to identify and elucidate the variables that exert a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of heart disease occurrence.
